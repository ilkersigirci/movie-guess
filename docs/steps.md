I want to create a movie name guess app with following steps

- Use Python fasthtml package
- Get the movie backdrops from tmdb randomly
- Show each backdrop with card component
- Create a text input for the user to type in movie name
- This input should fuzzy search all tmdb movies when typing
- If the user doesn't find in his first guess, show the next backdrop of the movie
